This blog is mostly for me to write down techy stuff so that:
1) I remember what the hell I did 3 years ago on a rapsberry pi
2) Maybe someone else gets a bit of benefit?
3) Practice and with any luck improve the art of writing. My job doesn't require that I write anything other than the odd email so hopefully I can practice that lost skill here. 

I my techy home life, I use a combo of linux and mac so try to write down how I achieve the same thing on both platforms, assuming it is possible. I've tried to live in the linux world complely but hobbies such as Music and compatabilities with certain bits of picky hardware keep me coming back to a mac as my main desktop. There are many things that linux does better but for 'just working' with basic stuff, you really can't beat a Mac.
